1. We should optimize the alternative beer proposal process
1.1. Check the alternative beer availability before making an alternative proposal to the customer.
1.2. Create a recommendation system to automate alternative selection process. Depending on the company's resources and goals it could have different technical implementations ranged from a simple list with beer classification to sophisticated assets tracking software. 
2. For further process optimization we can make the 'company - user' interaction more personal:
2.1 Track the order history for the customer, analyze and predict product choices and quantities.
2.2 Recommend new positions for the order (cross-selling and up-selling)
2.3 Introduce a loyalty program
